<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

__MUDP__ stands for _Messaging User Datagram Protocol_ and it is a UDP based protocol created by [_@joaoofreitas_](https://github.com/joaoofreitas) that sends and receives asynchronous encrypted messages from a peer to another.

This project is a code implementation of this protocol _(I consider the protocol itself just theory)_.

I decided to start this project mostly for learning and going a little bit deeper around networking. This project gave me skills in sockets, encryption, compression and raw packet networking.

Use cases:

- Full control of communication with another person without sniffing or network tracking.

### Built With

- [python](https://www.python.org)
- [rsa](https://pypi.org/project/rsa/)
